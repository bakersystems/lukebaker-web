Hey there,

I'm Luke Baker - software developer, systems administrator, and a self-described Kubernetes apologetist. I'm passionate about technology, open source, and everything in between. I find joy in fixing things and helping people do more of what they love. When I'm not working, you'll find me (trying) to keep up with my kids' growing list of hobbies and activities.

My career began at the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/), working initially as a desktop support technician and later a Linux systems administrator. After that I spent several years as a software developer at [VUHL](https://www.veteransunited.com/), with technical architecture mixed in. In 2020 I transitioned to the Infrastructure and now Platform Engineering team at [ESnet](https://www.es.net/), where I am still actively working today.
